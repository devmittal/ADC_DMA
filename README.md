# PES-Project-3
Made use of the ADC peripheral present on the FRDM KL25z to store the digital signal values in a buffer using DMA.
All the signals are displayed via UART on the terminal emulator in dBFS unit.
Peak level metering is done on this data.

Completed as part of Project 3 of the graduate course "Principles of Embedded Software".
